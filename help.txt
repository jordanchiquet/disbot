Graphs:
These are graphs that track message content in the channel. Actual message content is not recorded in anyway, (I'm not the government) but certain phrases trigger an incrementing tally. 
By default, these will return a ratio showing your count of the phrase in question vs your total word count. 
Example: ".fuck" will return a bar graph that shows which users say "fuck" the most compared to their total word count. 
If you would rather see a total count of how many times users have said "fuck" you can add "total" as an optional argument, e.g. ".fuck total". 

.fuck 
Returns count of the word fuck 

.south
